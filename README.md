# Surf's Up at Surf & Shake
## Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

### Analysis Overview
#### Sustainability of a new surf & ice cream shop
<BR>
 
An angel investor is interested in financing a Surf & Shake shop in O'ahu, Hawaii. The investor is primarily concerned that the weather, however, as he wants the shop to be open all year rather than seasonally. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable.
<BR><BR>

  

### Results
#### Temperature, precipitation, and sustainability
<BR>
• The temperature and precipitation difference in O'ahu in June and December is very small. There is a 4°F change in the mean temperature (8°F change in minimum temps, 2°F difference in high temps), and just under .1" difference in precipitation.

## Summary
#### It's time to invest!
 <BR>
With such slight difference in weather in summer & winter, the data illustrates to the investor that Surf & Shake will be able to stay open all year without weather worries. Based on the data we have I would advise the investor that Surf & Shake could be a portfolio-boosting investment.
 

### Further Analysis Needed
 <BR>

• Tourism data should be incorporated into the analysis. Is each month more dependent on tourists or locals? This will be helpful in determining if the store will need to shut down during "slow" months.
  <BR>
• As many people visit O'ahu to surf, we should consider using surfing-related weather such as high surf & extreme weather trends.
   <BR> 
• It would be prudent to compare more months out of the year, especially when it comes to precipitation. I don't feel that two months of data is enough to make a truly informed decision.
